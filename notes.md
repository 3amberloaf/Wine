### **Objective**
You aimed to train a machine learning model (`WineQualityTrainer`) using Spark and Hadoop, with the training dataset stored in an S3 bucket.

---

### **What You Did**
#### 1. **Prepared the Environment**
   - **Project Setup**:
     - Created a Maven-based Java project (`wine-quality-trainer`) to build your application.
     - Configured dependencies in `pom.xml`, including:
       - Apache Spark (`spark-core` and `spark-mllib` for machine learning tasks).
       - Hadoop AWS (`hadoop-aws`) for S3 integration.
       - AWS Java SDK for S3 operations.

   - **Configuration File**:
     - You added a `core-site.xml` file, specifying S3A (Amazon S3) configurations, including:
       - AWS Access Key and Secret Key.
       - S3A endpoint and file system implementation class.

   - **Code**:
     - Your Java program (`WineQualityTrainer`) loads the training dataset from S3 (`s3a://winesparkbucket/TrainingDataset.csv`), processes it using Spark, and trains a machine learning model.

---

#### 2. **Set Up and Validated Spark Cluster**
   - **Spark Master**:
     - Your Spark cluster is running at `spark://172.31.31.175:7077`, as indicated in the Spark UI screenshot.
   - **Workers**:
     - Your cluster has three active workers, each with 6 CPU cores and 6GB of memory.

   - **Submitting the Application**:
     - You submitted the application using the `spark-submit` command, specifying:
       - `--master spark://...`: Connects to the Spark master.
       - `--class WineQualityTrainer`: Specifies the main class of your application.
       - `--jars`: Includes necessary Hadoop and AWS libraries for S3 integration.

---

#### 3. **Debugged Access Issues**
   - Initially, your application failed due to:
     - Missing S3A classes (`ClassNotFoundException` for `org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem`).
     - Lack of access permissions for your S3 bucket (`403 Forbidden`).

   - **Fixes**:
     - Added `hadoop-aws` and `aws-java-sdk-bundle` dependencies to your project.
     - Updated `spark-submit` to include these JAR files with the `--jars` flag.
     - Checked and modified your S3 bucket permissions (though your AWS IAM role still lacked full access).

---

#### 4. **Executed Successfully**
   - After resolving the issues, you ran your Spark application successfully.
   - The Spark Master UI confirmed that your `WineQualityTrainer` job completed multiple times without errors.

---

### **What Happened During Execution**
1. **Application Submission**:
   - `spark-submit` sent your application JAR to the Spark master.
   - The Spark master distributed tasks to workers for parallel execution.

2. **Reading Data from S3**:
   - The program accessed the training dataset (`TrainingDataset.csv`) in your S3 bucket via S3A.

3. **Processing in Spark**:
   - The dataset was loaded into a Spark DataFrame.
   - Data transformations and a machine learning pipeline were applied using Spark MLlib.

4. **Job Completion**:
   - Once all tasks were executed, the application terminated successfully.
   - The trained model or processed output would be stored in the location you specified in your code (e.g., S3 or local storage).

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Verify Output**:
   - Check your S3 bucket or output path to ensure the model or results were saved correctly.

2. **Tuning and Optimization**:
   - You can experiment with Spark configurations (e.g., memory, cores, partitions) for better performance.

3. **Clean Up**:
   - If you used temporary credentials or public permissions, consider tightening your bucket permissions to avoid security risks.
